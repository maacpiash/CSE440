### Problem: K-Nearest Neighbors
The task here is to implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KN algorithm for machine learning.

#### Input format:
```
$ python classify.py [training_file] [test_file] knn [value_of_k]
```
Example:
`$ python classify.py satellite_training.txt satellite_test.txt knn 5`<br/>

The number of neighbors to consider is inputted as the `[value_of_k]` parameter.
